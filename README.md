## Tools for managing github class organization accounts

### Authentication

This package uses tokens for authentication with both [wercker](https://app.wercker.com/profile/tokens) and github, these values can be supplied via environmental variables `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `WERCKER_TOKEN` respectively or in `~/.github/token` and `~/.wercker/token`.

Alternative token locations can be specified with `set_github_token` or `set_wercker_token`.


### Example Session - Class setup

This section assumes that you have a roster file that has been read into R as a data frame, and this data frame includes a column called `github` which contains students' GitHub user names and a column called `team` that contains the team name for each student.

For example your roster file might look something like the following:

```csv
github,team
Alice,Team1
Bob,Team2
Carol,Team3
Dave,Team4
Eve,Team5
```

Using the `roster` data frame we can then invite the students to class' organzation as well as create and add them to their teams. 

```r
invite_users("Sta523-Fa17", roster$github)

## Adding Alice to Sta523-Fa17 ...
## Adding Bob to Sta523-Fa17 ...
## Adding Carol to Sta523-Fa17 ...
## Adding Dave to Sta523-Fa17 ...
## Adding Eve to Sta523-Fa17 ...
```

```r
create_teams("Sta523-Fa17", unique(d$Team))

## Adding Team1 ...
## Adding Team2 ...
## Adding Team3 ...
## Adding Team4 ...
## Adding Team5 ...
```
 
```r
add_team_member("Sta523-Fa17", roster$github, roster$team)

## Adding Alice to Team1 ...
## Adding Bob to Team2 ...
## Adding Carol to Team3 ...
## Adding Dave to Team4 ...
## Adding Eve to Team5 ...
```
 

### Example Session - Creating an assignment

```

```r
mirror_repo(source_repo = "Sta523-Fa17/hw2", dest_repo = get_repos("Sta523-Fa17","hw2-"))

## Cloning source repo (Sta523-Fa17/hw2) ...
## Mirroring Sta523-Fa17/hw2 to Sta523-Fa17/hw2-Team01 ...
## Mirroring Sta523-Fa17/hw2 to Sta523-Fa17/hw2-Team02 ...
