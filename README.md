## Tools for managing github class organization accounts

This package is for everyone\! But really, if you’re an instructor who
uses GitHub for your class management, e.g. students submit assignments
via GitHub repos, this package is definitely for you\! The package also
assumes that you’re an R user, and you probably teach R as well, though
that’s not a requirement since this package is all about setting up
repositories with the right permissions, not what your students put in
those repositories.

Install the development version package from GitHub:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("rundel/ghclass")
```

See package vignette for details on how to use the package.
